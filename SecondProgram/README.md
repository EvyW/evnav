The following is a program developed to address the large scale vehicle routing problem. This is a two-stages approach that implements a metaheuristic and a heuristic algorithm. The first algorithm is a Simulated Annealing that is in charge of reducing the number of routes. The second algorithm is a Large Neighborhood Search that minimizes the traveling cost, which in this case corresponds to the total distance. A data dictionary that describes format of the input data is included.
