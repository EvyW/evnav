The following is a program developed in python that generates a solution for the large scale Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The VRP is an optimization problem that aims at finding the best routes for a fleet of vehicles that depart of a unique depot (warehouse). The term "large scale" refers to the fact of having thousands of customers/nodes/locations that are visited by the vehicles. This is developed with the ortools.constraint\_solver library provided by Google OR-Tools optimization software
